## Overview

Reports related to a specific transaction (eg. order, invoice, etc.) or resource (eg. customer, product, etc.) can be found at the form including the data themselves. In this section other, general-purpose reports are available, which are processing the data for a given period or related to a specific work flow.<br />
Reports can be installed into databases. The kind of reports to be seen in this menu will depend on the database you are logged in and the reports available there.<br />
The Nervatura Framework supports several report types. Nervatura Reports are fully supported by Nervatura Client, and you can also export report data into MS Excel files.
